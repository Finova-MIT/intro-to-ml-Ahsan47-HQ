**Overview**

This repository contains intermediate-level machine learning tasks, focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The tasks are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook Intermediate_ML_tasks.ipynb.


**Contents**

This Jupyter Notebook file contains the practical implementation of Linear and Logistic Regression.
Two datasets have been worked on: California housing and Iris.
Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Model Training, and Evaluation have been implemented along with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.


**Running the Notebook**

To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:

pip install [the below packages/modules]

--> Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels

Then, follow the code snippets, which aren't very complicated to execute.
